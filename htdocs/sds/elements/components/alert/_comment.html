<p>Note that <code>.sds--page-container</code> is applied twice on this demo page, which is not desirable, but just convenient. For the alert component we normally assume to have full page-width so <code>.sds--page-container</code>, is needed inside. For the demo page it's convenient to have <code>.sds--page-container</code> on a high level, so for this demo page we breakout the alert.</p>
<p>Note that the alert doesn't always need a <code>.sds--page-container</code> inside. If it's placed inside an element that doesn't have full page-width, for example inside the <a href="#modal">modal</a> component.</p>

  <small>Note that applying icon-color is done by applying <code>.bg</code> to an element inside the svg. The lines are always white (no extra class needed).</small>
