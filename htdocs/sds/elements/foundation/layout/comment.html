<p>The grid, as defined in the documentation, is applied by the class "grid-container". Elements inside can span a number of columns and start at a certain column. This can be done by applying classes (eg "col-md--span-2", "col-lg--span-8"). These classes are specified per defined breakpoint.
If no class is applied the element wil span 1 column by default.</p>
