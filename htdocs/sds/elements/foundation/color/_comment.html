<p>Colors are defined as css-variable. The value of all color-variables are set on a high level (<code>:root</code>). If a color needs to be applied, you can do so by refering to the variable-name. All colors for the SURF Design System are applied this way.</p>
<p>The five predefined color palettes are also available. When a class is set (eg <code>.color-palette--purple</code>) the palette is applied and cascades down to all elements that make use of the palette. See for example <a href="#application-header">application header</a> where the red palette is applied to one of the demo's</p>
<p>
  <small>Note that applying color via inline style is not the normal way to go, but is only for demo purposes.</small>
