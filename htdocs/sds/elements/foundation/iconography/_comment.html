<p>Svg's by default appear in the currently applicable color. If, for example, a dark-mode theme is applied and the color is set to white on a higher level, the svg will appear in white.</p>
<p>Icons are mostly placed close to text. The width and height of the svg can then best be set in "em", so they will scale relative the font-size. Icons on the demo below are in their original sizes. Most other applied icons on this demo-page are outputted in "em". The "em" size can be calculated by dividing the px-size by the current font-size. <a href="#alert">Alerts</a> for example need icons with 22,5px width and height. So the "em" size will be 22,5/16 = 1,40625em</p>
