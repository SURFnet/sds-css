<p>Note that <code>.page-container</code> is applied twice on this demo page, which is not desirable, but just convenient. For the footer component we normally assume to have full page-width so <code>.page-container</code>, is needed inside. For the demo page it's convenient to have <code>.page-container</code> on a high level.</p>
TODO: only apply .page-container when relevant.
