<p>Note that <code>.sds--page-container</code> is applied twice on this demo page, which is not desirable, but just convenient. For the object-header component we normally assume to have full page-width so <code>.sds--page-container</code>, is needed inside. For the demo page it's convenient to have <code>.sds--page-container</code> on a high level, so for this demo page we breakout the object-header.</p>
